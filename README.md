# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game

In this notebook, I loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. 
I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. 
I used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. 
And also discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.
